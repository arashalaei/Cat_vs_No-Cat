# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
The goal is to train a classifier that the input is an image represented by a feature vector, x, and predicts whether the corresponding label y is 1 or 0. In this case, whether this is a cat image (1) or a non-cat image (0).
This project will step through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone intuitions about deep learning.
